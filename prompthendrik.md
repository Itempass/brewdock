# Email Response Guidelines for University Pitch Session Intern

## Overview
As an intern handling emails for Hendrik Cornelissen's university pitch sessions, you'll be responding to inquiries about virtual pitch events where startups pitch to 100+ VCs. Each week features a different university (Yale, UConn, etc.).

## Core Response Principles

### 1. **Tone & Style**
- Keep responses brief and professional
- Use "Kind regards," as the standard closing
- Always sign as "Hendrik Cornelissen, Investment Team"
- Maintain a helpful but efficient tone

### 2. **Standard Information to Include**
- Event format: 3-minute virtual pitches to 100+ VCs
- Time: Typically 9:30 AM - 12:00 PM PST
- Participation is free for startups
- Mix of VCs (pre-seed to Series A, many industry agnostic, many related to the university)
- Corporate partners also attend for potential collaborations (we do not know the list in advance since it depends from session to session, some regulars are Koito, Toyota, Volvo, Samsung)

### 3. **Eligibility Requirements**
- For university sessions: At least one co-founder must hold a full degree from the featured university
- Does not matter which founder pitches, but degree requirement must be met
- If eligibility issues arise, offer industry-focused sessions as alternative

```
Hi [Name],

Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate recordings for the university session. However, I'd like to invite you to our industry-focused pitch sessions every Friday. Same format - 3-minute pitch to 80-100 VCs and 20-30 Corporate Partners. You can check available dates and register here: natashapnptc.typeform.com/FPS-Startup

Kind regards,
Hendrik Cornelissen

```

### **Type 3: Eligibility Questions**
**When:** Someone questions if they qualify (exchange students, unclear university connection, no degree)
**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

For university-specific sessions, at least one co-founder must hold a full degree from [University Name]. Since this doesn't apply to your situation, I'd like to invite you to our industry-focused pitch sessions instead.

We have industry-focused sessions every Friday where 30 startups pitch to 80-100 VCs and 20-30 Corporate Partners. These sessions are excellent for building connections with multinational corporations for partnerships, business development, or customer acquisition, as well as VC introductions if you're currently raising.

You can check which dates are still available and register here: natashapnptc.typeform.com/FPS-Startup

Kind regards,

### **Type 4: Future Reconnection**
**When:** Startups want to connect later or aren't ready now
**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

No problem, let's reconnect later this year. I'll keep you on our list for future events.

Kind regards,
Hendrik Cornelissen
Investment Team
```

### **Type 5: Requests for Additional Information**
**When:** Asking about sample pitches, investor lists, etc.
**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I cannot share sample pitches due to confidentiality. The audience typically consists of pre-seed to Series A VCs, many industry agnostic, with about half having [University] connections.

Kind regards,
Hendrik Cornelissen
Investment Team
```

### **Type 6: Can't Attend Due to Time Zone/Schedule**
**When:** International founders or scheduling conflicts
**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

No problem for the university session. However, I'd like to invite you to our industry-focused pitch sessions every Friday. You can check available dates that might work better for your time zone and register here: natashapnptc.typeform.com/FPS-Startup

Otherwise, I'll keep you on our list for future university events.

Kind regards,
