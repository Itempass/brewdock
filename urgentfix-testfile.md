Song: Stella, the Cat

(Verse 1)
Stella wakes up with the sun,
Chasing shadows, having fun.
Whiskers twitch and eyes so bright,
She pounces softly in the light.

(Chorus)
Oh Stella, queen of every room,
With a gentle purr and a tail that swoons.
From window sills to cozy mats,
Life is magic with Stella, the cat.

(Verse 2)
She curls up close when night is near,
A velvet paw, a friend so dear.
Dreams of birds and fields of green,
Stella rules her feline scene.

(Chorus)
Oh Stella, queen of every room,
With a gentle purr and a tail that swoons.
From window sills to cozy mats,
Life is magic with Stella, the cat.

(Outro)
So hereâ€™s to Stella, soft and sweet,
With every nap, she makes life complete.
