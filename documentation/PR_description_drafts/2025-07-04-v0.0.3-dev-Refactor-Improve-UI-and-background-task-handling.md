### Title: Refactor: Improve UI and background task handling

### Summary:
This pull request introduces several UI/UX improvements and enhances the robustness of background task handling. Key changes include a new welcome screen for first-time users, a more intuitive agent creation flow, and better status reporting for background processes like tone-of-voice analysis. The backend now also handles interrupted tasks more gracefully on startup.

### Changes:

*   **Feature:**
    *   Added a welcome view (`NoAgentsView.tsx`) to guide new users when no agents are configured. (`frontend/app/page.tsx`, `frontend/components/NoAgentsView.tsx`)
    *   Added a warning in the settings for IMAP servers other than Gmail. (`frontend/app/settings/page.tsx`)

*   **Refactor:**
    *   Improved the agent creation modal to prioritize templates. (`frontend/components/CreateAgentModal.tsx`)
    *   Improved the user experience for tone-of-voice analysis by adding status polling and an expandable profile display. (`frontend/app/settings/page.tsx`, `api/endpoints/app_settings.py`, `frontend/services/api.ts`, `frontend/components/ExpandableProfile.tsx`)
    *   Replaced deprecated FastAPI `on_event("startup")` with `lifespan` for better startup/shutdown event handling. (`api/main.py`)
    *   PLACEHOLDER (does not work yet, but there to remind me in the future): On startup, any background tasks that were previously in a 'running' state are now marked as 'failed' to prevent them from getting stuck. (`api/main.py`)
    *   Updated Redis key management for tone-of-voice status. (`shared/redis/keys.py`, `api/background_tasks/determine_tone_of_voice.py`)

*   **Fix:**
    *   Corrected the name of the "Email Labeler" agent template. (`api/agent_templates/simple_email_labeler.json`)
    *   Changed the text in the top bar from "Agent" to "Agents" for consistency. (`frontend/components/TopBar.tsx`)
