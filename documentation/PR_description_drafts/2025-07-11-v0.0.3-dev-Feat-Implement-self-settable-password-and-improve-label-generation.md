### Title: Feat: Implement Self-settable Password and Improve Label Generation

### Summary

This pull request introduces a new authentication method allowing users to set their own password on the first run of the application. This enhances security and simplifies initial setup. Additionally, it refactors the label description generation logic to be more comprehensive and improves IMAP folder discovery.

### Changes

**Feature:**

*   **Self-settable Password:**
    *   Introduced a new `AUTH_SELFSET_PASSWORD` environment variable to enable a one-time, self-service password setup flow.
    *   The password is encrypted and stored in `data/keys/auth_password.key`.
    *   Relevant files: `api/endpoints/auth.py`, `frontend/middleware.ts`, `frontend/app/set-password/page.tsx`, `frontend/services/api.ts`.
*   **New Authentication Endpoints:**
    *   Added `/auth/status` to check the current authentication configuration.
    *   Added `/auth/set-password` to allow the first user to set the instance password.
    *   Added `/auth/verify` to validate session tokens against the currently active password.
    *   Relevant file: `api/endpoints/auth.py`.

**Refactor:**

*   **Label Description Generation:**
    *   The `generate_descriptions_for_agent` background task now overwrites existing labeling rules and populates them from all available inbox labels, ensuring descriptions are always generated for all user-defined labels.
    *   Relevant file: `api/background_tasks/label_description_generator.py`.
*   **IMAP Folder Discovery:**
    *   Enhanced the `FolderResolver` to recognize more special-use folder attributes (e.g., `\Important`, `\Flagged`) and added fallbacks for non-English folder names (e.g., 'Verzonden').
    *   Relevant file: `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/internals/connection_manager.py`.

**Documentation:**

*   **Password Setup Guide:**
    *   Created a new guide explaining the two authentication methods (fixed vs. self-set).
    *   Relevant file: `documentation/set_passwords.md`.
*   **README Update:**
    *   Updated the main `README.md` to link to the new security documentation.

**Chore:**

*   **`.gitignore`:**
    *   Added `.auth_password.key` and `.key` to prevent sensitive files from being committed.
    *   Relevant file: `.gitignore`.
