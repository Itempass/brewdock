# Refactor: Logging system to use API endpoints

## Summary

This pull request refactors the agent logging system to use API-based operations instead of direct database access. The changes improve security by removing exposed database credentials and centralizing logging operations through a dedicated API service. Additionally, a TypeError in the agent runner has been resolved.

## Changes

### Feature: API-based logging system
- **`agentlogger/src/database_service_external.py`**: Complete refactor from MySQL/SQLAlchemy operations to HTTP requests
  - Replaced direct database connections with `requests` library for HTTP operations
  - Updated API base URL to `https://mini-logs.cloud1.itempasshomelab.org`
  - Removed SQLAlchemy dependencies and database schema definitions
  - Implemented proper error handling for HTTP requests with timeout configuration
  - Updated method implementations for `add_review()` and `create_conversation_log()` to use API endpoints
  - Added request timeout configuration (30 seconds)
  - Simplified initialization by removing database setup requirements

### Fix: Agent runner tool result handling
- **`agent/internals/runner.py`**: Fixed TypeError when processing MCP tool call results
  - Updated result text extraction to use `result.content` instead of directly iterating over `result`
  - Resolves "'CallToolResult' object is not iterable" error

### Configuration: API endpoint updates
- **`agentlogger/src/database_service_external.py`**: Updated logging service endpoint
  - Changed from local server to dedicated logging server URL
  - Removed MySQL connection string and database credentials from codebase
