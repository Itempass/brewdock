### Title: Feat: Improve IMAP Password UX and Help Text

### Summary

This pull request enhances the user experience related to IMAP configuration by clarifying the Google App Password process. It updates the help text to be more direct and adds a contextual warning in the settings UI to prevent users from entering their regular Google password.

### Changes

-   **Feat:**
    -   In `frontend/components/settings/ImapSettings.tsx`, a warning message "This is not your regular Google Password!" is now displayed if the entered password does not conform to the 16-character format of a Google App Password. This warning is conditionally rendered based on the input's length after removing spaces.
    -   The `lucide-react` import was updated to include `AlertCircle` for the new warning icon.

-   **Docs:**
    -   The help component `frontend/components/help/GoogleAppPasswordHelp.tsx` has been updated to simplify the instructions for generating a Google App Password.
    -   The previous multi-step navigation guide is replaced with a direct link to the App Passwords page.
    -   An informational note was added, reminding users that 2-Step Verification must be enabled and that company accounts may have restrictions on App Passwords.
