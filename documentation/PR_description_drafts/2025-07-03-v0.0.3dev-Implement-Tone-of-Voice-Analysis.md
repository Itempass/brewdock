### Title: Feat: Implement Tone of Voice Analysis

### Summary
This pull request introduces a new feature that analyzes the user's email history to generate a detailed tone of voice profile. This profile is created on a per-language basis and can be used by AI agents to draft replies that more closely match the user's communication style. The feature includes a new MCP server for the analysis, API endpoints for management, and a new section in the frontend settings page to view the profile and trigger re-analysis.

### Changes

*   **Feature: Tone of Voice Analysis Engine**
    *   Introduced a new `tone_of_voice_mcpserver` responsible for analyzing email content.
    *   The analysis works by sampling user replies, comparing them to generic AI-generated responses, and using an LLM to build a detailed profile covering tone, style, and response patterns (`mcp_servers/tone_of_voice_mcpserver/src/internals/tone_of_voice_analyzer.py`).
    *   The service is containerized and managed via `docker-compose.yaml` and `supervisord.conf`.

*   **Feature: Background Task & API Endpoints**
    *   Added a background task `determine_tone_of_voice` to orchestrate the analysis and save the resulting profile to Redis (`api/background_tasks/determine_tone_of_voice.py`).
    *   Created new API endpoints:
        *   `POST /agent/rerun-tone-analysis`: Allows the user to manually trigger a new tone analysis (`api/endpoints/agent.py`).
        *   `GET /settings/tone-of-voice`: Retrieves the generated profile for display in the frontend (`api/endpoints/app_settings.py`).

*   **Feature: Frontend Integration**
    *   The "Settings" page now includes a "Tone of Voice Profile" section.
    *   This section renders the Markdown-formatted profile for each language detected in the user's inbox (`frontend/app/settings/page.tsx`).
    *   Added a "Rerun Analysis" button to trigger the process on demand.
    *   Added new frontend dependencies `react-markdown` and `@tailwindcss/typography` to support this (`frontend/package.json`).

*   **Chore: System Integration & Dependencies**
    *   Updated the inbox initialization process to detect and store the language of each email thread, which is required for language-specific analysis (`api/background_tasks/inbox_initializer.py`).
    *   Added the `langdetect` Python package to `requirements.txt`.
    *   Added new helper functions to the Qdrant client for analyzing payload distributions (`shared/qdrant/qdrant_client.py`).
    *   Registered new configuration and Redis keys (`shared/config.py`, `shared/redis/keys.py`).

*   **Fix: Minor IMAP Tool Correction**
    *   Corrected a variable name in the `find_similar_threads` tool function (`mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/tools/imap.py`).

*   **Test: IMAP Tooling**
    *   Added unit tests for the `find_similar_threads` tool to improve test coverage (`mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/tests/unit/test_imap_tools.py`).
