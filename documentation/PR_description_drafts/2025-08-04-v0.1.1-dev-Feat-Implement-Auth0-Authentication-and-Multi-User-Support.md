### Title: Feat: Implement Auth0 Authentication and Multi-User Support

### Summary

This pull request introduces a comprehensive authentication and multi-user support system. It replaces the previous single-user, password-based setup with a flexible system that can operate in three modes: `none`, `password`, and `auth0`. The implementation includes a new `user` module to handle all user-related logic, database schema changes to support multiple users, and extensive refactoring across the backend and frontend to enforce user-based data access and isolation. This change lays the foundation for features like user-specific settings, billing, and secure multi-tenancy. Also included are features for user balance, credit system, and cost history reporting.

### Changes

**Feature:**

*   **Comprehensive Auth System:**
    *   Implemented a flexible authentication system supporting `auth0`, `password`, and `none` modes, configured via environment variables.
    *   Added an `auth0_validator` (`user/internals/auth0_validator.py`) to validate Auth0-issued JWTs using the JWKS standard.
    *   Created a unified `get_current_user` dependency in `api/endpoints/auth.py` that handles all authentication modes, protecting all relevant API endpoints.
    *   The system now automatically finds or creates a user in the local database based on the validated Auth0 token's `sub` claim.

*   **User Management & Database:**
    *   Introduced a new `user` module (`user/`) to encapsulate all user management logic, including database interactions, authentication services, and models.
    *   Added a `users` table to the MySQL database (`user/schema.sql`) to store user information, including a unique UUID, Auth0 subject, email, and balance.
    *   Implemented database functions (`user/internals/database.py`) for creating, retrieving, and updating user records.

*   **User Balance & Credit System:**
    *   Implemented a user balance and credit system, tracked in the new `users` table (`user/schema.sql`).
    *   Added functionality to deduct costs from a user's balance for operations (`user/client.py`).
    *   Introduced cost and token tracking for workflow executions, logging usage data to the `agentlogger` database.
    *   Added a new API endpoint to expose aggregated usage statistics.

*   **Admin Management Dashboard:**
    *   Added a new "Management" page (`frontend/app/management/page.tsx`) for administrators to view all users and their current balances.
    *   The frontend now displays cost and token usage in the logs table.

**Refactor:**

*   **Multi-User Data Isolation:**
    *   Refactored `shared/app_settings.py` to manage all settings on a per-user basis, keyed by `user_uuid`. All calls to `load_app_settings` now require a `user_uuid`.
    *   Updated `shared/redis/keys.py` to generate user-specific Redis keys, ensuring that cached data, trigger states, and settings are isolated between users.
    *   Modified the Qdrant client (`shared/qdrant/qdrant_client.py`) to use user-specific collections (e.g., `user-{user_uuid}`), ensuring vector data is segregated.
    *   Updated the embedding service (`shared/services/embedding_service.py`) to load embedding models based on a user's specific configuration.

*   **Centralized Frontend API Client:**
    *   Created a centralized `apiFetch` wrapper (`frontend/lib/auth.ts`) that automatically attaches the Auth0 access token to all API requests when in `auth0` mode.
    *   Refactored all frontend services (`api.ts`, `promptoptimizer_api.ts`, etc.) to use the new wrapper.

*   **Trigger Service Multi-User Capability:**
    *   The main trigger service (`triggers/main.py`) now iterates through all registered users, checking for new mail and executing workflows for each one individually based on their own IMAP settings.

**Fix:**

*   **Security:**
    *   Prevented double encryption of the IMAP password in `api/endpoints/app_settings.py` by removing a redundant encryption step. A check was also added to prevent saving placeholder password values.

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Corrected the `TopBar` component (`frontend/components/TopBar.tsx`) to use a client-safe function for fetching the auth mode, resolving a client-side error.
    *   Fixed an issue where the backend would immediately reject requests without an `Authorization` header in auth mode, allowing the `get_current_user` logic to correctly handle anonymous and password-based modes.

**Chore:**

*   **Configuration and Dependencies:**
    *   Removed the obsolete `set_initial_embedding_model.py` script from the startup sequence in `supervisord.conf`.
    *   Added `jose` library for JWT validation.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Added a PlantUML diagram (`user/authentication_flow.puml`) illustrating the new Auth0 authentication flow.
