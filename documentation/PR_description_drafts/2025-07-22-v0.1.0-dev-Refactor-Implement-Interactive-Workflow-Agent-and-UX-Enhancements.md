### Title: Refactor: Implement Interactive Workflow Agent and UX Enhancements

**Summary:**

This pull request introduces a major refactoring of the workflow creation and management system, transitioning from a static agent-based model to an interactive, step-by-step workflow builder. The primary goal is to provide a more intuitive and flexible user experience for creating complex automation pipelines. Key features include a new interactive workflow agent, a redesigned UI with a clear separation of concerns, real-time updates, and a structured, hierarchical logging system. Additionally, this PR introduces an experimental prompt optimization engine and human-in-the-loop capabilities for feature requests.

**Changes:**

**Feature:**

*   **Interactive Workflow Agent:**
    *   Introduced a new interactive workflow agent that guides users through creating and managing workflows step-by-step.
    *   Replaced the previous static agent configuration with a dynamic, multi-step process (`workflow/internals/runner.py`, `workflow/client.py`).
*   **Redesigned Workflow UI:**
    *   Completely redesigned the frontend to support the new interactive workflow model (`frontend/app/workflows/page.tsx`).
    *   Implemented a clear three-column layout: a sidebar for workflow/log selection, a central panel for step configuration, and a right-hand panel for the chat-based workflow interaction (`frontend/components/WorkflowSidebar.tsx`, `frontend/components/WorkflowChat.tsx`).
    *   Steps are now editable in dedicated forms, with contextual help and dynamic placeholder insertion for referencing outputs from previous steps (`frontend/components/workflow/StepEditor.tsx`, `frontend/components/workflow/editors/`).
*   **Prompt Optimization Engine (experimental!):**
    *   Added a new prompt optimization engine to refine and evaluate system prompts for LLM-based workflow steps (`prompt_optimizer/service.py`, `frontend/components/prompt_optimizer/`).
    *   Users can create evaluation templates and view optimization results directly in the UI.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop for Feature Requests:**
    *   Implemented a mechanism for the workflow agent to request human input when it needs clarification or additional information for a feature request (`frontend/components/chat_input/FeatureRequestForm.tsx`, `api/endpoints/agent.py`).
*   **Structured Logging:**
    *   Implemented a new structured, hierarchical logging system for better traceability and debugging of workflow executions (`agentlogger/`, `api/endpoints/agentlogger.py`).
    *   Logs are now displayed in a dedicated, filterable view in the frontend (`frontend/app/logs/page.tsx`).

**Refactor:**

*   **API and Backend:**
    *   Refactored API endpoints to support the new workflow structure (`api/endpoints/workflow.py`).
    *   Moved all code over to the new workflow system (`workflow/models.py`).
*   **Frontend Components:**
    *   Broke down large components into smaller, reusable ones for better maintainability (e.g., `StepEditor`, `TriggerSettings`, editor components in `frontend/components/workflow/editors/`).
    *   Improved UI consistency, state management, and navigation across the application (`frontend/`).
    *   Added a timezone-aware date placeholder for use in prompts (`frontend/hooks/useTimezone.ts`).

**Chore:**

*   **Configuration and Dependencies:**
    *   Updated `docker-compose.yaml` and `supervisord.conf` to reflect the new service structure.
    *   Updated `requirements.txt` and `package.json` with new dependencies.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Added new plans and draft PR descriptions related to the new features.
