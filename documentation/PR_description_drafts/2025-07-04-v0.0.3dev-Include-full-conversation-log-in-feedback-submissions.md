### Title: Fix: Include full conversation log in feedback submissions

### Summary:

This pull request modifies the feedback submission process to include the complete conversation log. Previously, only the feedback text was submitted. This change provides essential context for developers when reviewing user feedback, by attaching the full agent interaction data to the review. The implementation involves updates to the backend API to accept the additional log data and adjustments to the frontend to fetch and send this data.

### Changes:

*   **Backend:**
    *   **API:** The `/agentlogger/conversations/{conversation_id}/review` endpoint now accepts a `log_data` field containing the full conversation object (`api/endpoints/agentlogger.py`, `api/types/api_models/agentlogger.py`).
    *   **Service:** The `agentlogger` service and its external database client have been updated to handle and pass along the `log_data` (`agentlogger/src/client.py`, `agentlogger/src/database_service_external.py`).
    *   **API:** The `get_single_conversation` endpoint now returns a dictionary instead of a Pydantic model to ensure proper JSON serialization (`api/endpoints/agentlogger.py`).

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **State Management:** The logs page now fetches the entire conversation object upon selection and stores it in its state (`frontend/app/logs/page.tsx`).
    *   **API Call:** The `addReview` service function has been updated to send the feedback text along with the complete `log_data` (`frontend/services/api.ts`).
    *   **Component Refactor:** The `ConversationDetail` component was refactored to accept the conversation object directly as a prop, simplifying its logic by removing local state management for data fetching (`frontend/components/ConversationDetail.tsx`).
