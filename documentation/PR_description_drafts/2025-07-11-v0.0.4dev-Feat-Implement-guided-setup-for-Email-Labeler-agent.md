### Title: Feat: Implement guided setup for Email Labeler agent

### Summary

This pull request introduces a guided initialization process for the "Simple Email Labeler" agent. Instead of starting with pre-defined labels, the user is now prompted to either automatically generate label rules by scanning their inbox or to load a set of common examples. This change makes the agent more adaptive to the user's existing email organization. To support this, the underlying IMAP label detection has been refactored to be language-agnostic, correctly identifying user-defined labels by filtering out system folders.

### Changes

-   **Feature:**
    -   Implemented a two-step setup flow for the Email Labeler agent, allowing users to choose their initialization method. This is handled in `frontend/components/AgentSettingsAbstracted.tsx`.
    -   Added a background task in `api/background_tasks/label_description_generator.py` that uses an LLM to automatically generate descriptive rules for labels by analyzing a sample of emails.
    -   Introduced two new API endpoints in `api/endpoints/agent.py`:
        -   `POST /agents/{agent_uuid}/generate-descriptions`: Triggers the asynchronous generation of label descriptions.
        -   `POST /agents/{agent_uuid}/apply-template-defaults`: Applies a set of default example labels to the agent.
    -   Updated `frontend/services/api.ts` with corresponding functions to call these new endpoints.

-   **Refactor:**
    -   Enhanced the IMAP label discovery logic in `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/client.py`. The `_get_all_labels_sync` function now correctly filters system folders (e.g., `\Inbox`, `\Sent`) and non-selectable folders, making label detection robust and language-independent.
    -   Modified the `api/agent_templates/simple_email_labeler.json` template to separate the example labels into a `param_values_template`, allowing the agent to be created initially without any hardcoded rules.

-   **Chore:**
    -   Removed the obsolete `api/agent_templates/github_labeler.json` template.
