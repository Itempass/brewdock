### Title: Refactor: Enhance Inbox Indexing and Enable Dynamic Trigger Tools

### Summary
This pull request introduces two key enhancements. First, it improves the email indexing process by fetching threads from both "Sent Mail" and "All Mail", ensuring a more complete dataset for background processing. New metadata fields, `type` and `contains_user_reply`, are added to messages and threads respectively to support more nuanced filtering. Second, it adds a dynamic tool execution capability to the trigger evaluation system, allowing trigger conditions to leverage real-time information, starting with the `find_similar_threads` tool.

### Changes

*   **Feature: Comprehensive Email Indexing**
    *   Modified the inbox initialization process to fetch threads from `[Gmail]/All Mail` in addition to the existing `[Gmail]/Sent Mail`, then merges and deduplicates the results. This provides a more complete view of the inbox.
        *   `api/background_tasks/inbox_initializer.py`
    *   Updated the bulk thread fetching mechanism to accept a target `mailbox`, increasing its flexibility.
        *   `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/client.py`
        *   `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/internals/bulk_threading.py`
    *   Added a `contains_user_reply` boolean flag to `EmailThread` and a `type` literal ('sent'/'received') to `EmailMessage` to allow for more specific filtering and analysis.
        *   `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/models.py`
    *   The background task for tone-of-voice analysis now specifically targets threads containing a user reply.
        *   `api/background_tasks/determine_tone_of_voice.py`

*   **Feature: Tool Execution in Trigger Conditions**
    *   Implemented a mechanism to process `<<TOOLRESULT:...>>` tags within trigger condition prompts.
    *   The `triggers/main.py` service now detects the `<<TOOLRESULT:IMAP:find_similar_threads>>` tag, executes the corresponding tool, and injects the JSON result into the prompt for the trigger-checking LLM.
        *   `triggers/main.py`
