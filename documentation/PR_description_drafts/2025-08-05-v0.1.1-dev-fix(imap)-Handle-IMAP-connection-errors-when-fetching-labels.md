### Title:
fix(imap): Handle IMAP connection errors when fetching labels

### Summary:
This pull request improves the error handling for IMAP connections within the workflow agent. Previously, IMAP connection failures were silenced, leading to incorrect feedback for the user (e.g., showing "no labels found" instead of a connection error). This change ensures that connection errors are properly propagated and handled, providing clear and actionable feedback to the user.

### Changes:
- **Error Handling:**
    - Modified `get_all_labels` in `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/client.py` to re-raise `IMAPConnectionError`. This prevents the error from being caught by the generic exception handler, ensuring it is not silenced.
    - Updated the `get_email_labels_with_descriptions` tool in `workflow_agent/mcp/tools.py` to specifically catch `IMAPConnectionError`.
    - When an `IMAPConnectionError` is caught, the tool now returns a user-facing error message prompting them to check their IMAP settings.
- **Dependencies:**
    - Added an import for `IMAPConnectionError` in `workflow_agent/mcp/tools.py` to handle the specific exception.
