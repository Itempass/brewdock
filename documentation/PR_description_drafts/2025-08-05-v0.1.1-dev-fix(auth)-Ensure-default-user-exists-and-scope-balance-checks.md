### Title: fix(auth): Ensure default user exists and scope balance checks

### Summary:

This pull request resolves a critical "User not found" error that occurred in "no-auth" mode by ensuring a persistent default user record is always available. It also refactors the balance management system to exclusively apply to Auth0 users, preventing unintended balance checks for non-Auth0 users.

### Changes:

- **Fix:**
    - Implemented a `get_or_create_default_user` function to guarantee the existence of a default user, resolving a race condition and preventing crashes in non-authenticated modes. (`user/internals/database.py`, `user/client.py`)
    - Updated the `get_current_user` dependency to use this new function, standardizing user retrieval for password-based and no-auth modes. (`api/endpoints/auth.py`)

- **Refactor:**
    - Scoped the `check_user_balance` and `deduct_from_balance` functions to only execute for users with an `auth0_sub`, effectively limiting balance management to Auth0-authenticated users. (`user/client.py`)

- **Chore:**
    - Removed the now-redundant `get_default_user` and `get_default_system_user` functions to clean up the codebase. (`user/internals/database.py`, `user/client.py`)
    - Removed extraneous logging of sensitive values from `shared/security/encryption.py` and `shared/app_settings.py`.
