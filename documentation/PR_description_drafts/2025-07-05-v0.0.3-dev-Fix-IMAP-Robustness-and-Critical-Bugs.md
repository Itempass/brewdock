**Title:** fix: Improve IMAP robustness and resolve critical bugs

**Summary:**
This pull request addresses several critical bugs to enhance the application's stability and robustness. The primary change introduces language-agnostic IMAP folder discovery by implementing RFC 6154 for special-use folders, resolving a major issue for users with non-English email clients. Additionally, this PR fixes a silent failure in the inbox initialization process, resolves a port conflict caused by the MCP Inspector, and improves the visibility of the App Password help link in the UI.

**Changes:**

*   **Fix: Language-Agnostic IMAP Folder Handling**
    *   Implemented a `FolderResolver` class to dynamically discover special-use folders (`\Sent`, `\All`, `\Drafts`, etc.) using the IMAP SPECIAL-USE extension (RFC 6154), replacing hardcoded English folder names.
    *   Refactored the core IMAP client (`mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/client.py`), bulk threading (`internals/bulk_threading.py`), and the trigger polling loop (`triggers/main.py`) to use the resolver, making them compatible with non-English email accounts.
    *   The `imap_connection` context manager in `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/internals/connection_manager.py` now provides the resolver instance alongside the connection.
    *   Added unit tests for the updated client logic (`mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/tests/unit/test_client.py`).

*   **Fix: Prevent Silent Inbox Initialization Failure**
    *   Enhanced the `inbox_initializer` background task to explicitly check if any threads were successfully processed.
    *   If vectorization fails for all threads or if no recent threads are found, the initialization status is now correctly set to "failed" to prevent the process from appearing successful when it wasn't.
    *   Relevant file: `api/background_tasks/inbox_initializer.py`.

*   **Fix: Resolve MCP Inspector Port Conflict**
    *   Commented out the MCP Inspector ports by default in `docker-compose.yaml` to prevent port conflicts when the inspector is not explicitly enabled.
    *   Updated documentation (`documentation/mcp_inspector.md`, `documentation/port_configuration.md`) and the startup message in `supervisord.conf` to instruct users on how to enable the ports.

*   **Chore: Improve UI/UX**
    *   The "App Password" help button in the settings UI is now more prominent, featuring an icon and clearer text to improve user guidance.
    *   Relevant file: `frontend/app/settings/page.tsx`.

*   **Docs: Add RFC 6154 Implementation Plan**
    *   Added a new planning document detailing the strategy for implementing language-agnostic folder support.
    *   Relevant file: `documentation/plans/2025-07-08-implement-rfc6154-special-use-folders.md`.
