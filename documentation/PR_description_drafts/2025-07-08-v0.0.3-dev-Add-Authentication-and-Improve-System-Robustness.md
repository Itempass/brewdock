### Title: Add Authentication and Improve System Robustness

**Summary:**
This pull request introduces a simple password-based authentication layer (only enabled if password is provided in .env). It also includes several significant improvements to the system's robustness, such as a data vectorization versioning system so we can automatically update the vector db if we make significant changes, along with key bug fixes and refactors to improve tool quality and frontend user experience.

**Changes:**

*   **Feature: Simple Authentication**
    *   Adds a backend login endpoint and frontend login page to protect the application with a password defined in `env.example`.
    *   New files:
        *   `api/endpoints/auth.py`
        *   `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`
        *   `frontend/middleware.ts`
        *   `env.example`
    *   Dependencies: `js-cookie` added to the frontend.

*   **Feature: Vectorization Data Versioning**
    *   Implements a versioning system to check for mismatches between vectorization logic and stored data.
    *   On startup, a new `startup_orchestrator.py` script checks the version and triggers a re-vectorization of the inbox if the versions do not match.
    *   Relevant files: `shared/config.py`, `scripts/startup_orchestrator.py`, `supervisord.conf`.

*   **Refactor: Improve `find_similar_threads` Tool**
    *   Refactors the `find_similar_threads` tool to return a clean, directly usable markdown string instead of a JSON object.
    *   This simplifies the logic in the trigger prompts and improves the clarity of the tool's output.
    *   Files changed: `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/tools/imap.py`, `triggers/main.py`.

*   **Fix: Preserve Agent Tool Order**
    *   Corrects a bug in the agent settings that caused the order of required tools to be scrambled upon saving. The UI order is now correctly preserved.
    *   File changed: `frontend/components/AgentSettings.tsx`.

*   **Fix: Enhance Backend Status Check**
    *   The `BackendStatusChecker` component no longer forces a page reload, preventing disruptive loops and providing a smoother user experience while waiting for the backend to start.
    *   Files changed: `frontend/components/BackendStatusChecker.tsx`, `frontend/app/layout.tsx`.

*   **Chore: Update Templates and Formatting**
    *   Updates the `repetitive_emaildrafter.json` template for higher quality output.
    *   Enhances the markdown formatting of email threads for better readability in prompts.
    *   Files changed: `api/agent_templates/repetitive_emaildrafter.json`, `mcp_servers/imap_mcpserver/src/imap_client/models.py`.
