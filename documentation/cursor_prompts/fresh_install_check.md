# Fresh Install Check

## Goal
Your goal is to check if our project is correctly configured to work on a fresh install on the first try. 

A (non-exhaustive!) list of things you should check:
- All files that are needed to install our Dockerfile / docker-compose file are present when pulling this project freshly from github. Mistakes can be buried because a file exists in our local dev environment.
- All needed packages are present in requirements.txt. You can check this 






## Output Rules
- Do NOT make any changes
- Summarize your findings in bullet points
