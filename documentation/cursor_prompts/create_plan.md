Your goal is to create an actionable, complete plan of a new feature.

## Steps
1. Check the current date using `TZ="CET" date +%Y-%m-%d`
2. Create a new markdown file in /documentation/plans with title yyyy-mm-dd-descriptive-feature-name.md 
3. Ask clarifying questions to the user
4. Create the plan
5. Now there will be back and forth with the user to finalize the plan. DO NOT IMPLEMENT.

## Format
- the plan should be easy to understand for a junior developer
- do not include code in the plan, but do include data formats where needed (eg. json structure)
- make sure to reference files (eg. example files that the junior developer should read, files that should be edited)
